implementing standard evaluation metrics to see how well a model performs in diagnosing diseases.

learning objectives:
- Calculate true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives.
- Calculate sensitivity and specificity
- Calculate Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV).
- Understand confidence intervals, ROC curve, and F1 score.


### 1. Key Evaluation Metrics
- Sensitivity, Specificity, and Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy in terms of conditional probability
- Sensitivity, Specificity and Prevalence
- PPV, NPV
- Confusion Matrix

### 2. How does varying the threshold affect evaluation metrics?
- ROC Curve and Threshold
- Varying the Threshold

### 3. Interpreting Confidence Intervals correctly
- Sampling from the Total Population
- Confidences Intervals
- 95% CI Interpretation
