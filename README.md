# AI-Medicine-Projects
AI for Medical Diagnosis, Prognosis and Treatment:
- Diagonosis: the process of determining which disease or condition explains the person's symptoms, signs and medical results

### Diagnosis Projects
- build an algorithm that will look at a chest X-ray and identify disease causes
- implement evaluation methodologies to assess the quality of model
- use image segmentation to identify the location and boundaries of brain tumors in MRI scans
### Prognosis Projects: predicting the future health of the patients
- Use structured data to predict the risk of an event
  - patient's lab values and their demographics

### Treatment: medical care
- information extraction out of medicail texts
- use machine learning models to estimate what the effect of a particular treatment would be on a patient
